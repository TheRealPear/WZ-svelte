  <ol>
    <li>Any statistics, participation in matches, and other gameplay-related events are compiled to allow for profile pages and match pages.</li>

    <li>Any messages you send to the server are stored on our Discord server and stored in match pages for moderation purposes.</li>
    <li>Any purchases made in our store are processed directly through 3rd party services (PayPal, Stripe, and Xsolla) and not the Warzone administration.
